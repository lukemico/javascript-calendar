# Responsive Calendar with Events

A Calendar built using JavaScript with custom event list feature, and Materialize responsive CSS framework.

## Project Outline

This exercise involves 2 parts -

1. The first task is to develop a calendar using JavaScript that renders days, weeks and months in a responsive format.

2. The second task is to develop a UI for a calendar, that a user can navigate to select a date, and create an event for the specified date.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine before installation:

Install Git [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (latest version)  
Install Python [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (latest version)

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/lukemico/javascript-calendar.git

cd javascript-calendar
```

then follow instructions in the Running a Local version section.

## Steps for running a Local version

To start the server locally using Python SimpleServer, run the following via the Command Line:

In your terminal, 'cd' or change directory into whichever directory you wish to have accessible via browsers and HTTP.

```
  cd javascript-calendar  (to ensure you are in the correct folder)
```

-   To start a HTTP server on port 8000 (default port), type in Command Line:

```
  $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]
```

-   After you hit the Enter key, you should see the following message:

```
  Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

-   Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the application in your browser.

You should now be directed to a locally hosted version of the Calendar exercise.
